twitter-market
==============

An experiment to grow an account's twitter market and reach and then build it into a funnel.

Premise
-------
1. Followgen got it right. Klout and PeerIndex get it wrong but they at least give you feedback.
2. All twitter notifications are adverts.
3. The different types of twitter notifications have different responses depending on your market context:
   - organic.
   - spam.
   - retweets.
   - favourites.
   - conversation replies.
4. Many users will follow back accounts run by people that they do not know. Some for reasons of brand recognition or self-interest in follow backs, but others due to evaluation of messages, similarity to themselves, number of followers or kin selection.
5. I wish to take a punt on peer-selection. I believe that in certain cases the "Followed By" header is used as a heuristic by people choosing whether to follow accounts. Unapologetically, I wish to game it.
